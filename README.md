Chocolatey package for Rubberduck.  It's on the chocolately repo now so if you
have [chocolatey installed](https://chocolatey.org/install) already run in
powershell,

```
    PS> choco install rubberduck
```

## Packaging yourself
Clone the repo then package and install

    PS> cd Rubberduck-Choco
    PS> choco pack
    PS> choco install rubberduck -s $pwd
```
# SOMEONE CLAIM ME

I'm leaving this repo orphaned since I haven't used rubberduck in over a year
and barely touch windows devices any more.
